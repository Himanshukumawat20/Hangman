Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game. Test your vocabulary and guessing skills as you try to uncover the hidden word letter by letter.

## Features

- Random selection of words from a predefined word list.
- Interactive gameplay with user input for guessing letters.
- Visual representation of the game state with ASCII art hangman stages.
- Dynamic display of the word with underscores for unrevealed letters.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshukumawat20/Hangman.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd Hangman
   
3. Run the game:

   
    main.py
   

4. Guess letters one at a time to uncover the hidden word.

5. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman being drawn.

6. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word before the game ends.

7. Have fun and enjoy playing Hangman!
